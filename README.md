## Part 1: Customer Segmentation based on RFM Analysis

Understanding customer behavior is crucial for targeting customers efficiently, and increasing revenue. To accomplish this, I worked on an online retail dataset and utilized pgAdmin for PostgreSQL. The customer segmentation was based on the RFM analysis concept, which focuses on three main factors:


1️⃣ **Recency**: How recent the last transaction occurred.

2️⃣ **Frequency**: How frequently a customer made purchases from our store.

3️⃣ **Monetary**: How much each customer has paid for the company's products



Considering the numerous potential combinations of R, F, and M, managing such a large number of permutations becomes challenging in terms of implementing effective marketing strategies. To address this, I reduced the permutations by calculating the average scores for frequency and monetary, as both factors provide valuable insights into purchase volume.



## Part 2: Data Analysis and Deriving Insights

The second part of the project involved analyzing the dataset to extract meaningful insights. I achieved this by crafting 9 queries that reveal a story about the data, highlighting the following aspects:



🌍 **Country-level Analysis:**

🔸 Identifying the country with the highest number of transactions.

🔸Determining the country that contributes the most revenue.

🔸Identifying the customer with the highest number of transactions.

🔸Identifying the countries with customers who made the most transactions.

🔸Identifying the countries with customers who contributed the most to revenue.

🔸Identifying the product that sold the most in the country with the highest number of transactions.


📦 **Product-level Analysis:**

🔸Determining the overall best-selling product.

🔸Identifying the product that is consistently the top seller across different countries.

🔸Identifying the product that contributes the most to the revenue.


⏰ **Time-Level Analysis:**

🔸Identifying the quarter with the highest number of transactions and the most significant revenue increase.



📈 By applying customer segmentation and conducting in-depth data analysis, businesses can make informed decisions, develop effective marketing strategies.
